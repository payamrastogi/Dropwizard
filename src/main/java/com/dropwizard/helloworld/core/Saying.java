 * First, itâ€™s immutable. This makes Saying instances very easy to reason 
 * about in multi-threaded environments as well as single-threaded environments. 
 * Second, it uses the Java Bean standard for the id and content properties. 
 * This allows Jackson to serialize it to the JSON we need. 
 * The Jackson object mapping code will populate the id field of the JSON object 
 * with the return value of #getId(), likewise with content and #getContent(). 
 * Lastly, the bean leverages validation to ensure the content size is no greater than 3.
